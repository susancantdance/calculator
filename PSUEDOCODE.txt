If A is null, Store digits as user enters them consecutively into a string A by concatenating ("100")
    Update display to this string with each digit
When user hits operand button, stop
If A is not null, store next set of digits as a second string B by concatening ("20")
    update display to this string with each digit
When user hits operand button, stop

If user hits clear, clear display, clear variables
If user hits a math operand and A or B are null, store operand
    keep listening for digits
If user hits a math operand and A and B are not null, store operand unless it is '='
    convert string A and string B into numbers
    call operate(A, B, operand) and
        update display with answer
        store answer into A (for more calcuations)
        IF user hits another operand key
            await digits to be entered into B
        IF user hits another digit key
            Clear everything
            store digit into string A 

If user hits '=' 
    check if A & B & Operator are not null
    if any of them are null, do nothing



4 + 5 =  (9)
9 - 3 * (6)
2 - 5 = (7)
